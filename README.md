This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Lua programming related to nil values. The `foo` function attempts to handle nil arguments, but there is an implicit assumption about what happens when both `a` and `b` are nil. Lua returns nil in this situation but this may be unexpected behavior that needs explicit handling. The solution shows a more robust way to handle nil values using the or operator.
